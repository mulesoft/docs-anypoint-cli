== datagraph sources add

----
> datagraph sources add <gav>
----

This command adds an API source, specified by `<gav>`â€”the group, asset, and version of the API source. 
 
In addition to the default `--help`, `-f/--fields`, and `-o/--output` options, this command accepts the following default options:

[%header,cols="30a,40a,30a"]
|===
| Options | Description
|`-p` | Prompts for a password.
|`-P` | Reads a password from `STDIN`.
|`--headers` | Use if you authenticate to your API by passing `client_id` and `client_secret` headers.
Set headers using a comma-separated list of `key:value` pairs.
|`--query-params` | Use if you authenticate to your API by passing `client_id` and `client_secret` query params.
Use a comma-separated list of `key:value` pairs.
|`--headers-file` | Specifies the file containing header `key:value` pairs, one pair per line.
|`--query-params-file` | Specifies the file containing query param `key:value` pairs, one pair per line.
|`url` | Configures the URL for the backend API.
|`--discover-url` | Automatically discovers the URL of the backend API based on the instances running in the current environment. If more than one APIs is running, DataGraph uses the first URL.
|`--discover-url-api-instance` | Automatically sets the URL of the backend API based on the provided API instance.
|`--ca` | Specifies a list of certificate authority (CA) files to add to the API's truststore.
|`--cert` | Specifies the client certificate to use for mTLS.
|`--key` | Specifies the private key to use for mTLS.
|`--keyPassword` | Specifies the password to decrypt an encrypted private key.
|`--delete-ca` | Deletes all CA certificates.
|`--no-mtls` | Deletes the client certificate, private key, and private key password information.
|===

[NOTE]
All headers and query params defined in the command line and the headers and query params files are appended. If there are repeated keys, the values provided in the command line takes precedence.
