== cloudhub load-balancer list

----
> cloudhub load-balancer list [options]
----
This command lists all load balancers in your Anypoint Platform. It displays load balancer's name, domain, its state, and the Anypoint VPC ID to which the load balancer is bound.

This command accepts only the default options: `--help`, `-f`/`--fields` and `-o`/`--output`.

== cloudhub load-balancer describe

----
> cloudhub load-balancer describe [options] <name>
----
This command displays information about the load balancer that is specified in `<name>`.

You can start typing your load balancer's name and press`tab` for Anypoint Platform CLI to autocomplete it, or you can double tap `tab` for a full list of all the values you can pass.

It displays load balancer's name, domain, its state and the Anypoint VPC Id to which the load balancer is bound.

This command accepts only the default options: `--help`, `-f`/`--fields` and `-o`/`--output`.

== cloudhub load-balancer describe-json

----
> cloudhub load-balancer describe [options] <name>
----
This command displays a raw JSON response from the load balancer that is specified in `<name>`.

You can start typing your load balancer's name and press`tab` for Anypoint Platform CLI to autocomplete it, or you can double tap `tab` for a full list of all the values you can pass.

This command accepts only the default options: `--help`, `-f`/`--fields` and `-o`/`--output`.

== cloudhub load-balancer create

----
> cloudhub load-balancer create [options] <vpc> <name> <certificate> <privateKey>
----
This command creates a load balancer using the specified values in the variables.
[%header,cols="12,53a,35a"]
|===
|Value |Description |Example
| `vpc` |Name of the Anypoint VPC to which this load balancer is bound. +
If your Anypoint VPC name contains spaces, you need to pass it between ´"´ characters. | `vpc-demo`
| `name` |Name for the load balancer. | `newtestloadbalancer`
| `certificate` |Absolute path to the `.pem` file of your server certificate in your local hard drive. +
Your certificate files need to be PEM encoded and not encrypted. | `/Users/mule/Documents/cert.pem`
| `privateKey` |Absolute path to the `.pem` file of your private key of the server certificate in your local hard drive. +
Your private key file needs to be passphraseless. | `/Users/mule/Documents/privateKey.pem`
|===

[CAUTION]
--
The name for the load balancer that you pass in `<name>` must be unique. +
By default, your load balancer listens external requests on HTTPS and communicates with your workers internally through HTTP. +
If you configured your Mule application within the Anypoint VPC to listen on HTTPS, make sure you set `upstreamProtocol` to HTTPS when creating the mapping list using the <<cloudhub-load-balancer-mappings-add,load-balancer mappings add>> command.

Besides the default `--help`, `-f`/`--fields` and `-o`/`--output` options, this command also takes:

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Value |Description

|`tlsv1`  | Supports TLSv1 in addition to TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2
|`dynamic-ips` | Uses dynamic IPs, which are not persistent through restarts
|===
