[[cloudhub-vpc-list]]
== cloudhub:vpc:list

----
> cloudhub:vpc:list [flags]
----
This command lists all available Anypoint VPCs. It returns ID, region, and environment of the network and whether it is the default Anypoint VPC or not.

This command has the `--output` flag. Use the `--output` flag to specify the response format. Supported values are `table` (default) and `json`.


[[cloudhub-vpc-describe]]
== cloudhub:vpc:describe

----
> cloudhub:vpc:describe [flags] <name>
----
This command displays information about the Anypoint VPC that is specified in `<name>`.

Use the flag `-o json` to get the raw JSON response of the application you specify in `<name>`.

This command has the `--output` flag. Use the `--output` flag to specify the response format. Supported values are `table` (default) and `json`.

This command accepts only the default flag `--help`.

[[cloudhub-vpc-create]]
== cloudhub:vpc:create

----
> cloudhub:vpc:create [flags] <name> <region> <cidrBlock> [environments...]
----
This command creates an Anypoint VPC using the name in `<name>`, in the region specified in `<region>`, with the xref:runtime-manager::vpc-provisioning-concept#faq_how_to_size_vpc[size] passed in `<cidrBlock>` in the form of a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block, using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#IPv4_CIDR_blocks[CIDR notation] and associates it to the xref:access-management::environments.adoc[environments] passed as argument(s) thereafter.

[NOTE]
An Anypoint VPC needs to be bound to a business group within your organization. When creating an Anypoint VPC, make sure to assign it a business group using the <<cloudhub-vpc-business-groups-add, business-groups add>> command.

Besides the default `--help` flag, this command also has the `--default` flag. When passed, the Anypoint VPC is created as the default Anypoint VPC for the selected environment.

This command has the `--output` flag. Use the `--output` flag to specify the response format. Supported values are `table` (default) and `json`.


[[cloudhub-vpc-delete]]
== cloudhub:vpc:delete

----
> cloudhub:vpc:delete <name>
----
This command deletes the Anypoint VPC specified in `<name>`.

[WARNING]
This command does not prompt twice before deleting. If you send a delete instruction, it does not ask for confirmation.

This command accepts only the default flag `--help`.

[[cloudhub-vpc-environments-add]]
== cloudhub:vpc:environments:add

----
> cloudhub:vpc:environments:add [flags] <vpc> [environments...]
----
This command assigns the Anypoint VPC defined in `<vpc>` to the environment(s) passed as argument(s) thereafter. +
The `--default` flag allows setting an Anypoint VPC as the default for the organization, which applies to all environments which don't have an Anypoint VPC explicitly associated.

This command also has the default `--help` flag.

[[cloudhub-vpc-environments-remove]]
== cloudhub:vpc:environments:remove

----
> cloudhub:vpc:environments:remove [flag] <vpc> [environments...]
----
This command removes the Anypoint VPC defined in `<vpc>` from the environment(s) passed as argument(s) thereafter. +
Besides the default `--help` flag, this command also has the `--default` flag, that removes this Anypoint VPC as the default Anypoint VPC for the environment.

[[cloudhub-vpc-business-groups-add]]
== cloudhub:vpc:business-groups:add

----
> cloudhub:vpc:business-groups:add [flags] <vpc> <businessGroups...>
----
This command assigns the Anypoint VPC defined in `<vpc>` to the business group(s) passed as argument(s) thereafter.

This command accepts only the default flag `--help`.

[[cloudhub-vpc-business-groups-remove]]
== cloudhub:vpc:business-groups:remove

----
> cloudhub:vpc:business-groups:remove [flags] <vpc> <businessGroups...>
----
This command removes the Anypoint VPC defined in `<vpc>` from the business group(s) passed as argument(s) thereafter +

[WARNING]
This command does not prompt twice before removing the Anypoint VPC from the specified resource. If you send a remove instruction, it does not ask for confirmation.

This command accepts only the default flag `--help`.

[[cloudhub-vpc-dns-servers-set]]
== cloudhub:vpc:dns-servers:set

----
> cloudhub:vpc:dns-servers:set [flags] <vpc>
----
This command sets a list of local host names (internal domain names) to be resolved using your DNS servers for which you need to provide their IP addresses (whether private or public addresses). +
Whenever those private domains are provided, your worker resolves them using your private DNS, so you can still use the internal host names of your private network.

[NOTE]
This feature is supported by workers running Mule versions 3.5.x, 3.6.x, 3.7.4, 3.8.0-HF1, 3.8.1 and 3.8.2.


Besides the default `--help` flag, this command also accepts:

[%header,cols="20a,80a"]
|===
|Flag |Description
| `--server` | IP address for a DNS server to resolve special domains on. Can be specified up to 3 times
| `--domain` | A domain to resolve on the special DNS server list. Can be specified multiple times
|===

You can pass as many domains as you need, and up to 3 IP addresses. +
For example, `$ cloudhub:vpc:dns-servers:set --domain example.com --server 192.168.1.10 <VPC Name>`.

Every time you run this command, you overwrite your previous DNS set command. +
To remove a DNS set, you need to use the <<cloudhub-vpc-dns-servers-unset,vpc dns-servers unset>> command.

[[cloudhub-vpc-dns-servers-unset]]
== cloudhub:vpc:dns-servers:unset

----
> cloudhub:vpc:dns-servers:unset [flags] <vpc>
----
This command clears the list of local host names (internal domain names) to be resolved using your DNS servers from the Anypoint VPC passed in `<vpc>`.

This command accepts only the default flag `--help`.

[[cloudhub-vpc-firewall-rules-describe]]
== cloudhub:vpc:firewall-rules:describe

----
> cloudhub:vpc:firewall-rules:describe <vpc>
----
This command describes all the firewall rules for the Anypoint VPC defined in `<vpc>`.

This command has the `--output` flag. Use the `--output` flag to specify the response format. Supported values are `table` (default) and `json`.

This command also accepts the default flag `--help`.

[[cloudhub-vpc-firewall-rules-add]]
== cloudhub:vpc:firewall-rules:add

----
> cloudhub:vpc:firewall-rules:add [flags] <vpc> <cidrBlock> <protocol> <fromPort> [toPort]
----
This command adds a firewall rule to the Anypoint VPC defined in `<vpc>` using the values set in the variables: +

[%header,cols="18a,62a,20a"]
|===
|Value |Description |Example
| `vpc` |Name of the Anypoint VPC to which this load balancer is bound. +
If your Anypoint VPC name contains spaces, you need to pass it between ´"´ characters | `vpc-demo`
| `cidrBlock` | IP address in CIDR notation for the firewall to allow  | `192.0.1.0/27`
| `protocol` | The protocol to use in the rules. It can be `tcp` or `udp` | `tcp`
| `fromPort` | The port from which the firewall will allow requests. It can go from 0 to 65535 | `8888`
| `toPort` | *optional* In case a port range is needed, the `fromPort` and `toPort` variables define such range | `8090`
|===

[CAUTION]
--
When creating an Anypoint VPC, make sure to allow your outbound address. +
By default, all IP addresses are blocked, and you need to authorize IP addresses or range of addresses to your Anypoint VPC firewall rule.
--

This command accepts only the default flag `--help`.

[[cloudhub-vpc-firewall-rules-remove]]
== cloudhub:vpc:firewall-rules:remove

----
> cloudhub:vpc:firewall-rules:remove <vpc> <index>
----
This command removes the firewall rule from the workers inside the Anypoint VPC specified in `<vpc>` at the index passed in the `<index>`.

This command accepts only the default flag `--help`.
